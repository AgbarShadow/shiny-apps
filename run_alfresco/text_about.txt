This R Shiny web application enables a user to launch ALFRESCO jobs on SNAP's Atlas cluster conveniently via an internet browser.
The user selects options for their ALFRESCO job and then submits the job.
The ALFRESCO job will run followed by post-processing of ALFRESCO outputs in R yielding some stock summaries, graphics, and data.
When complete, these results are emailed to the users of the app.
Also included in the email is a link to new, an auto-generated Shiny app that provides interactive exploration of the post-processing results
Results from multiple ALFRESCO jobs can be compared in the results app as long as they are each launched with the same run group name.

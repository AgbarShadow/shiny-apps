### Getting Started

#### Introduction
  
This **R** Shiny web application compares downscaled outputs from CMIP3 and CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) in a variety of ways.
Downscaled observation-based historical data from the Climatological Research Unit (CRU 3.1) can be included in comparisons as well. 
Four general plot types are available: time series plots (not time series analysis),
scatter plots, heat maps, and various plots designed more specifically to highlight variability.
Below you can find more information regarding the data in this app, and how to manipulate and graph it.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The plots available in the app allow for an in-depth graphical analysis of the included downscaled climate model outputs and CRU data.
Nevertheless, they provide an exploratory as opposed to confirmatory analysis of the data.
This is not to take away from their value. Much can be gleaned from the wide range of customizable plots which can be produced.
In fact, any confirmatory data analysis should be preceded by exploratory data analysis.
This is just to say that no inferences are inherent in the graphs. There is no statistical modelling being performed.
It is strictly a descriptive analysis; a visual (and tabular) representation of the data - 
ignoring for the moment that the GCMs include projected model outputs out to year 2100 (or that the earlier years of CRU data over Alaska also have increasing uncertainty),
but that has nothing to do with what this app does with the data provided to it.

### App Layout
This is not your grandmama's R Shiny app. So let's start simple.

#### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar at the top has the typical `Home` tab, followed by a tab for each type of plot available in the app, labelled
`Time Series`, `Scatter Plot`, `Heat Map`, and `Variability`, and finally an `About` tab.
The tabs which have to do with the actual graphical EDA are split into left and right panels.
Data selection and plot formatting occurs on the left. Graphs and tables appear on the right.

#### Data Selection Panel
The data selection panel appears in the top left corner under the navigation bar.
But there is no reason for it to appear on the `Home` tab, so make sure to navigate over to `Time Series` for example and then it will become available.
By default the panel is open on app launch with the data selection checkbox checked.
This reveals a number of options.
Until data selection is completed, there is nothing else to display, no plot options panel, and of course, no plots or tables.

#### Plot Options Panel
The plot options panel appears directly beneath the data selection panel. Similar to the data selection panel, it is visible only when relevant.
You must be on a plot tab in the navigation bar.
It also does not appear below the data selection panel if data selection has not been completed.
When displayed, the plot options panel offers a number of powerful options for organizing the data in a plot various ways such as grouping and faceting,
as well as basic formatting options like color, transparency, and font size.

#### Graphs and Tables
Graphs and tables appear on the right for any plot tab.
Tables appear first. Tables are ready for display as soon as data selection occurs, even though plot options have not been set yet by the user.
Once plot options are set and a plot is generated, the plot will appear at the top of the right panel, bumping any table further below.
